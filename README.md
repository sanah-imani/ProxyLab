# ProxyLab

Implementation of a concurrent multi-threaded proxy with a cache. A web proxy is a special type of proxy server whose clients are typically web browsers and whose servers are web servers providing web content. When a web browser uses a proxy, it contacts the proxy instead of communicating directly with the web server. The proxy forwards the client's request to the web server, reads the server's response, then forwards the response to the client.
